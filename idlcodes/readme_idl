In this directory are the idl routines that read the data files output from the MFE code

Please look at the beginning of each of the routine files to see the purpose and the calling
syntax of that routine.

Here is an example to call the getv1.pro routine, to read the b1 field at a particular time step into IDL:

IDL> datadir='/Users/yfan/work/data/orszag-tang/xy_mfe_expand1/run.mfe_expand1/' ;full path of the run directory 
IDL> it=100 ;specify the time step, e.g. 100
IDL> getv1,datadir,it,v1,x1_v1,x2_v1,x3_v1,time_v1

Then you will get in IDL the following data:
;v1: array for v1 velocity component
;x1_v1: x1 grid position of v1 array
;x2_v1: x2 grid position of v2 array
;x3_v1: x3 grid position of v3 array
;time_v1: time of the snapshot

Similarly you can read in other variables (v2, v3, b1, b2, b3, rho, pres)
at the time step by calling getv2.pro, getv3.pro, getb1.pro, getb2.pro, getrho.pro, getpres.pro

The routine readgrid.pro reads the "grid.dat" file written by the code, which contains all the grid
variables used in the code. See the beginning of the readgrid.pro routine for the syntax to call it.

The routine readphysparams.pro reads the "physparams.dat" file written by the code, which contains the
physical constants and parameters, and the normalizing units used by the code. See the beginning of the
routine for the syntax to call it to read the quantities into IDL.
